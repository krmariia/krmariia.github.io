 <h1> My first Camera </h1> 
 <p> I was 5 years old, when I took photocamera in my hands for the first time. My family, as well as others at that time, had a film camera. Latter, we bought one more - simple Kodak for average users.
 Average camera - amateur photos. But when I turned fifteen, my parents bought me Canon 600D... my first professional camera, which I am using nowadays as well.</p> 
 <h2> Experience </h2> 
 <p> To begin with, I have never visited any photo courses, exept the required one - Video Production at my university. Since I received the present (Cannon 600D), I started to experiment
 and thus gradually learned everything I know on my own. I am still not a professional, nevertheless I am able to work in Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop and DaVicni Resolve, I continue learning,
 as there is always place for self-development.Having camera is not enough, you need to have willing to do what you like and developed imagination, to notice what others cannot see.
 However, I am photoshoting only 2 years, I already got a chance to participate in several exebitions in my hometown. </p>
